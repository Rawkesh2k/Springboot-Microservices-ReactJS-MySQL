**Project Description:**

This project involves a comprehensive microservices architecture using **Spring Boot**, **ReactJS**, and **MySQL**. The architecture is designed to deliver a scalable and maintainable system with the following components:

1. **API Gateway Service**: Acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns such as security and logging.

2. **Department Service**: Manages department-related operations and data, providing endpoints to handle CRUD operations related to departments.

3. **Employee Service**: Handles employee information and operations, enabling the management of employee records and interactions.

4. **Organization Service**: Manages organizational data and structure, facilitating operations related to organizational units and hierarchies.

5. **React Frontend**: The client-side application built with ReactJS, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface to interact with the microservices.

6. **Service Registry (Eureka)**: Handles service discovery, allowing microservices to register themselves and discover each other, enabling dynamic routing and load balancing.

7. **Spring Config Server**: Centralizes configuration management for microservices, providing a single source of truth for application configuration properties.

8. **Zipkin Server**: Provides distributed tracing for the microservices, enabling the tracking of requests across different services and visualizing performance metrics.

9. **MySQL**: The relational database management system used to store persistent data for the microservices, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.
